Baby, would I lie to you?
Baby, do you think I'm lying to you?
Uh, would I ever lie to you?
You know, baby, I would never ever lie to you

I think of you when I'm alone
I've been to London, Paris and Tokyo
You know that I could be your Romeo
But you treating me like Pinocchio

Uh, you t-t-t-t-treating me like a little wooden boy
Well, girl, I'm telling you for you I do got wood and boy!
I'd let you pull my strings any day; I'm your puppet baby
Spinning right round and round, like a record player

You're running round my thoughts everyday
Doing laps of the tennis courts in my brain
Let's stop, take a break, we could go to Stockholm
Or another capital city like Helsinki or Rome

Home? We could stay in, get a pizza watch some Netflix
K-k-kisses on the sofa from Brett's lips
We could share a tray of jumbo fish and chips
Pop the cork on a bottle of cheap fizz.

I think of you when I'm alone
I've been to London, Paris and Tokyo
You know that I could be your Romeo
But you treating me like Pinocchio

Seems like I'm always flying solo
Whether to London, Paris or Tokyo
I don't have to be this lonely, though
But you keep treating me like Pinocchio

Uh. Well I've Seen the film and I don't resemble the character
In any way. And anyway, who made you a barrister
Of character assassination? So in the animation
You'd be the bad guy fox, giving me aggravation

You're saying I'm a liar, that my pants are on fire
My attire's noncombustible, it's stylish and functional
Let's put this all behind us, I'm a lover not a fighter
That's what makes me so damn loveable

Baby, would I lie to you?
Baby, do you think I'm lying to you?
Uh, would I ever lie to you?
You know, baby, I would never ever lie to you.
